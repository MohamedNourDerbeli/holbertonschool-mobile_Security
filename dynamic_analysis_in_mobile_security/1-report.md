# Dynamic Analysis Report: Hooking Native Functions in Android

## üß© Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we were tasked with dynamically analyzing an Android application that uses native code via the Java Native Interface (JNI). The objective was to hook into the native function, intercept its behavior, and retrieve a hidden flag that is processed in native code but not shown in the UI.

- **Target APK:** Apk_task1
- **Flag:** `Holberton{native_hooking_is_no_different_at_all}`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Frida**: Dynamic instrumentation toolkit
- **ADB**: Android Debug Bridge
- **Objection**: Runtime mobile exploration toolkit
- **Android Studio**: For APK analysis and possible emulation
- **Device/Emulator**: A rooted device or emulator with Frida server running

---

## üîç Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analyze App Behavior

- Installed the APK (`Apk_task1`) using `adb install`.
- Launched the app and inspected the UI: no clear way to view any flag.
- Concluded that the flag is likely processed internally in native code and never shown.

---

### 2. Locate Native Library

- Used `adb shell run-as <package_name>` to inspect the app‚Äôs internal directories.
- Identified native library file `libnative-lib.so` inside `/data/data/<package>/lib/`.
- Confirmed usage of JNI function: `Java_com_holberton_task2_1d_MainActivity_getSecretMessage`.

---

### 3. Identify and Inspect Exported JNI Functions

- Ran the following Frida command to list symbols:
  ```bash
  frida -U -n task1_d -e "Module.enumerateSymbolsSync('libnative-lib.so').filter(s => s.name.indexOf('getSecretMessage') !== -1)"
  ```

- Found the exact symbol name to hook:
  e.g., `Java_com_holberton_task2_1d_MainActivity_getSecretMessage`.

---

### 4. Hook Native Function with Frida

- Created and ran a Frida script (`hook.js`) as follows:

```javascript
Interceptor.attach(Module.findExportByName("libnative-lib.so", "Java_com_holberton_task2_1d_MainActivity_getSecretMessage"), {
    onEnter: function (args) {
        console.log("[*] getSecretMessage() called");
    },
    onLeave: function (retval) {
        console.log("[*] getSecretMessage() returned:");
        console.log(hexdump(retval, {
            length: 64,
            ansi: true
        }));

        // Attempt to read the returned string from memory
        console.log("[*] Flag: " + Memory.readUtf8String(retval));
    }
});
```

- Executed the hook:

  ```bash
  frida -U -n task1_d -l hook.js
  ```

- Upon triggering the native function (by interacting with the app), Frida printed:

  ```
  [*] Flag: Holberton{native_hooking_is_no_different_at_all}
  ```

---

## üèÅ Result

- ‚úÖ **Decrypted Flag:** `Holberton{native_hooking_is_no_different_at_all}`
- Retrieved directly from memory via Frida hook into native function.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This challenge demonstrated that even when sensitive data is processed entirely in native code (via JNI), it is still accessible at runtime. With tools like Frida and a basic understanding of Android's internals, we were able to:

- Identify and hook a native function.
- Extract sensitive runtime data (the flag) without access to the source code.
- Prove that obfuscation or JNI usage is not sufficient protection by itself.

This reinforces the importance of **multiple layers of security**, including runtime protection and encryption, when dealing with sensitive logic or data in mobile applications.
